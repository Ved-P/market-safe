# Market Safe

A COVID - 19 related hackathon project that allows users to see AI reccomendations to go to some store and reserve a spot to go to that store, and also functions as a contact tracing site.

As the COVID - 19 pandemic fades out, we will all eventally have to step out of our houses, whether it is to get groceries or medicine. However, we need to do it in a way that is carefully planned, or else we might face a second wave. Market-Safe is a web application that allows customers and local businesses in the community connect to plan in person visits. It also functions as a contac tracing app! Look below to see all the great things that can be done with Market Safe!

## Customers can...

- search for businesses in the community.
- view a business.
- get an AI reccomendation about the business using data and machine learning.
- reserve a spot to go to that store on a certain day.
- ask the application to send alerts to people they have been in contact with in the case of testing positive.
- view alerts on whether they may have been in contact with someone who tested positive.

## Businesses can...

- view and edit analytical data used by our machine learning algorithm.
- see who has reserved a spot to visit their store in person.
- open or shut down their stores.
- view alerts on whether they may have been in contact with someone who tested positive.

## What's in the future for Market Safe?

- allow customers to reserve a specific time slot rather than just a day.
- allow businesses to customize the page that the customers see when they visit their site.
- add more AI to help businesses create standards that will minimize the chance of spreading diseases.
