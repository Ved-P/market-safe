# Contributing to Market Safe

## Important!

This is a hackathon project. For this reason, I cannot accept any contributions from the GitHub community as of now (July 23, 2020). However, the results for the hackathon will be published on August 1, 2020, and if you would like to contribute to this project, I will start looking at Pull Requests from August 2, 2020.

The hackathon, <hack> Cupertino, has a website that can be found [here](https://hackcupertino2020.devpost.com/).

Keep in mind the following information. This is a Django web application and uses the languages of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Knowledge of all four of these languages as well as the Django framework is reccomended. After making a change to the code, please make sure that __all__ pages work as expected. Thank you for following these guidelines.
